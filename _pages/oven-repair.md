Broken cooktop, range or stove might ruin your daily kitchen routine. Don’t let this problem suck your energy – fix it!

{:.big}
If your oven, cooktop, or range won’t work, first check the circuit breaker and test for power. If it’s on, test the surface purner (make sure you have a standard one) and the burner switch. If your oven temperature doesn’t look right, check if controls, oven selector and temperature switches are set in a proper way. If not, set temperature level to the desired one and test for voltage.

Or, instead of these steps, call Air Comfort LLC! Mind that working with high voltage is dangerous, and calling a professional will be much safer.
